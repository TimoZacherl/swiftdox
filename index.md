# <i class="fab fa-swift"></i> SwiftDox

SwiftUI is a new Cross Platform UI Framework introduced in WWDC2019.  
This page should represent a basic documentation of the different swiftui components.

## Background

Why am I maintaining this third party docs?

I started using SwiftUI a while ago and I had some struggle with the official documentations.  
Don't get me wrong here, the official docs are pretty solid, but I like to see some examples in between all these methods, declarations and cryptic usage guides.  
And most important, I want to properly search the docs!

## Future Plans

I am working hard on adding all of SwiftUI at the moment.

In WWDC2020 Apple anounced their new software versions and with that, they added lots of new cool things to SwiftUI, which I will add next.

Later in the future I may add even more stuff related to Swift and SwiftUI, so stay tuned!
